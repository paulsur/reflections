How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It allows you to narrow down to just the lines of code that have changed between versions. Thus, you can spot changes and errors more easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It's easier to go back to previous versions when necessary. You can also see how your projects have progressed over time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git was created to version control code which often has changes across multiple files. Google Docs is generally for documents where each file is a complete component on its own.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You have a guaranteed "undo" function to go back to a version that you know worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My future projects so that I have a record of changes. I will also see a timeline of my progress.
